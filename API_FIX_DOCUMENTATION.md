# API Server Fixes - Technical Documentation

## Issue
The API server was experiencing HTTP 500 errors when accessing the `/v1/analysis/summary` endpoint due to non-JSON compliant values (NaN/Null/Infinity) in the data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Data Serialization in `runtime_api_server.py`

The primary issue was the presence of empty values in the CSV data that were being read as `NaN` by pandas and causing JSON serialization errors. We implemented a robust solution that:

- Properly handles `NaN`, `null`, and `Infinity` values in the CSV data
- Converts infinite values to strings to maintain their semantic meaning
- Replaces `NaN` values with `null` for proper JSON serialization
- Added detailed error logging to help with debugging

```python
# Key fix in get_summary endpoint
# Convert to records, handling special values
records = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    record = {}
    for col in df.columns:
        val = row[col]
        if pd.isna(val) or pd.isnull(val):
            record[col] = None
        elif isinstance(val, float) and (val == float('inf') or val == float('-inf')):
            record[col] = str(val)  # Convert inf/-inf to strings
        else:
            record[col] = val
    records.append(record)
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling for the Weights Endpoint

Enhanced the robustness of the weights endpoint to:
- Check if the weights file exists
- Better handle JSON parsing errors
- Add detailed error logging

### 3. Applied the Same Fixes to Web Dashboard API

Ensured consistency by applying the same fixes to the web dashboard's FastAPI routes in:
`/web_dashboard/server/routers/analysis.py`

### 4. Enhanced Testing Framework

- Improved the existing test scripts to better detect API issues
- Added the comprehensive API test to the `run_system.sh` workflow
- Implemented better error reporting and debugging information

## Testing Results

All tests now pass successfully:
- `/v1/analysis/summary` endpoint returns 42 records with proper null handling
- `/v1/analysis/weights` endpoint returns data for 7 market types
- System integration tests in `run_system.sh` pass successfully

## Notes for Future Maintenance

1. When working with pandas and JSON serialization, always handle special floating-point values:
   - `NaN` values should be converted to `None`
   - `Infinity` values should be converted to strings or handled appropriately

2. Consider adding data validation to the analysis notebook that generates the CSV files to ensure data quality before API consumption.

3. The comprehensive test script (`test_api.py`) should be run after any changes to the API or data processing logic.
